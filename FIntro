before double clicking on any of the .exe files, make sure 
you have the microsoft visual c redistributable.
you start the application by running "MguardSends.exe" with 
administrator privillages. you do not have to run mSsSVC.exe
or mCsSVC.exe, the application will automatically decide if 
they need to be executed. always launch the application in
administrator mode, or it may malfunction. you need to allow 
the app through your firewall as well.
